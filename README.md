4. Select your dependent variable and two factors

5. Click "Jalankan Two-Way ANOVA" to perform the analysis

## Example Data Format

Your data should include:
- One continuous dependent variable (numeric)
- Two categorical independent variables (factors)

Example structure:
```
BeratBadan,JenisPakan,BreedSapi
285,Konsentrat,Brahman
290,Konsentrat,Brahman
310,Konsentrat,Limousin
325,Konsentrat,Simental

## Interpreting Results

The application provides comprehensive output to interpret your Two-Way ANOVA results:

1. **ANOVA Table**: Shows test statistics, F-values, and p-values
2. **Effect Sizes**: Indicates the magnitude of effects (small, medium, large)
3. **Post-hoc Tests**: Pairwise comparisons when main effects are significant
4. **Interaction Analysis**: Visualizations to understand how factors interact
5. **Conclusions**: Automatically generated interpretations based on statistical results
